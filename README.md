# YTsort

## About

A webpage to help you catch-up and binge your favourite YouTube channels.

Search for a YouTube channel you'd like to binge or catch-up on and specify the sorting criteria to receive a sorted playlist of videos. Users can search for either the most viewed or top rated videos of a channel from a specified time frame (past week, past month, past year, etc).

## Setup

## Future Work
Add feature to allow a user to export the list of sorted videos returned by the search to a YouTube playlist belonging to their YouTube account.
